# REA43

The three-drug version of REA. It follows the same tutorial as REA and GREA, and test data are included. Similarly the following syntax calls the REA43 package. 

*data = table2array(readtable('ery_cm_sal.csv'));*
*f = REA43_package(data);*

The result f is a vector that contains SI and AI.
